    <h2 class="progressTitle" style="text-align:center; color: white;">Progression of the project</h2>

    <ol style="color: white;">
        <li>To start with, I started with most of the project being based off of project 2.</li>
        <li>I set out with wanting to create a site where users could upload there code files and allow them to be downloaded if set to public.</li>
        <li>Once I had the base of project 2, I deleted what I didnt need such as anything correlated to budget and journal.</li>
        <li>Once that was done, I set out to reformat the everything related to tasks to fit my needs for what I'll now call Programs.</li>
        <li>The first step to getting the site working once the unneccesary material was gone, I adjusted my settings.py and models.py for accepting a fileField.</li>
        <li>To do this, I needed to add a few lines at the bottom of settings.py and introduce fileField in my models and forms for programs with the directory set to media/documents.</li>
        <li>I ended up creating two models pertaining to my programs: Program model and Program Category model which was used within the program model.</li>
        <li>After the models were created, I then went on to adjust the views to allow for file upload.</li>
        <li>I then ran the program and tested to ensure that the file upload was working as intended.</li>
        <li>The next problem I tackled was deleting the files associated to the models.</li>
        <li>After many hours, I found that the best solution for this was to use django-cleanup, which deletes files associated to models whenever their models are deleted.</li>
        <li>Once the upload and delete were working correctly, I began to work on the download mechanism for files.</li>
        <li>This was a simple solution but took me a while to figure out. I had to add a line to urls.py and then I just used row.upload.url and download attribute in an href to make the files downloadable.</li>
        <li>After download was working properly, we then went on to adjust the edit page so that we can edit which files have been uploaded and their descriptions.</li>
        <li>I still have yet to figure it out completely, but as of now the only way to edit an input is you can't change the file linked to the model.</li>
        <li>That is a bug that I have been unable to fix unfortunately and decided to move on from for timesake.</li>
        <li>Once the edit page was done, Tommy helped me out with styling the site and finishing the about page.</li>
        <li>The styling made the site look a lot more uniform and dynamic, without being too overbearing.</li>
        <li>After the site was completed, we then dockerized it and uploaded it to GCP.</li>
    </ol>
